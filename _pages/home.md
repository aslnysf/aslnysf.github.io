## Brief Bio
Yusuf Aslan is currently working at the national cybersecurity team (TR-CERT) as a software
engineer. He took part in the Kasirga and Hazne projects. These are projects that aim to scan
active IPs in public institutions across the country, identify security vulnerabilities and
provide feedback. Then he designed and proposed a project that will result in a platform for
Automatic Android Malware analysing with Machine Learning (ADAM). The project aims
to provide the opportunity to customize the analysis to be made and to create a dataset from
the analysis results. This platform will be used by more than 1700 security teams of public
institutions.
